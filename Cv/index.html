    To say a litte bit about myself, currently I am studying software engineering in Addis 
    Ababa Institute Of Technology. I completed highschool at St.Mary's  
    catholic school in 2018 Gc.I have a passion for art and literature  
    I also developed a hobby of drawing a picture and painting
    as well. I hope to draw astonishing drawings in the future. 
    I love reading novels in my spare time. I aspire to  
    become an independent woman. <br>


    My ambition is to be one of the competitive programmers in our country. 
    I am certain to mention that the future technology will be more 
   advanced and paves a way for programmers to make our
    world a better place to live.In addition to my career I want to be talented artist. <br>


    <h1>Art Talks</h1>
    Art is the way to speak without words. It is a process of seeing ourselves deep inside and reflect
    our inner feeling out with the help of our drawing tools. Every points, lines of a painting have their
    own meanings, the way they are lined, their thickness and also the shades and color… all of it. It is an 
    expression of ideas and emotions, with the creation of certain artistic qualities, having its unique visual 
    language.  I can say it is a visual book. For the one who understands, it is capable of telling the message 
    it carries. I can put the artist is on the place of the writer, the painting board is the paper, the paint 
    colors are the ink of the pen, the paint brush is the pen and the story is the beautiful mix of colors telling
    the story from the beginning till the end. It endows freedom. 
    I never thought that I would be this kind of talented artist, well now I am. And I am proud to be. My friends 
    and family members used to tell me that I should keep up my good works and also continue to draw, I think I should 
    follow their advice. Once, the greatest writer said,<strong> “…for the eye sees not itself but by reflection, by some other
    things”.</strong>
